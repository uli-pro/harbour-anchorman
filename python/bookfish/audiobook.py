"""An audiobook opened for listening: its chapters in order, each with the
file it is in, where in the file it begins and how long it is.

A single file (MP3 or M4B) has the chapter marks of its tags, or is one
chapter. In a folder each MP3 file is a chapter; their own marks are not
read, as they often belong to the whole book. Reading hundreds of files
from a memory card took up to a minute on the device (single reads hang for
seconds), so a folder opens at once with lengths estimated from the file
sizes and names from the files; the tags are read afterwards and kept in a
cache, which is used as long as no file has changed.
